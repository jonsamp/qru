# QRU?

QRU? is a QR code debugging app built originally to help debug [EAS Update](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/introduction/) QR codes. Now, it's a general purpose QR code scanner that breaks down scanned data into its component parts, making it easy to inspect what's inside any QR code.

## Features

- **Scan QR codes** with a live camera view
- **Colorized URL breakdown** showing protocol, host, path, and query parameters at a glance
- **Copy** scanned data to the clipboard
- **Generate QR codes** from any previously scanned URL for sharing with other devices
- **Scan log** to revisit and manage previously scanned codes
