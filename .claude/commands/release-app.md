# App Store Metadata Generation

This is the most interactive phase. Generate drafts for ALL required fields.

## Gather Context First

Ask:

```
To generate your App Store metadata, I need to know more about your app:

1. List 3-5 key features of your app
2. What makes it different from competitors?
3. What problem does it solve for users?
4. Any awards, press mentions, or user testimonials?
5. What category best fits? (Games, Productivity, Health & Fitness, etc.)
```

## Apple App Store Metadata

### App Name (30 characters max)

```
📱 App Name

Your app name should include a keyword for discoverability.

Generated options:
1. [App Name] - [Keyword] (X/30 chars)
2. [Variation 2] (X/30 chars)
3. [Variation 3] (X/30 chars)

Tip: Including a keyword increases ranking by ~10%
```

### Subtitle (30 characters max)

```
📝 Subtitle

Expands on your name with secondary keywords. Don't repeat words from the name!

Generated options:
1. [Subtitle option 1] (X/30 chars)
2. [Subtitle option 2] (X/30 chars)
3. [Subtitle option 3] (X/30 chars)
```

### Keywords (exactly 100 characters)

```
🔑 Keywords (Apple only)

Apple gives you exactly 100 characters. Use ALL of them! Comma-separated, no spaces after commas.

Important rules:
- Don't include words already in your app name or subtitle
- Don't use plurals if you have the singular (or vice versa)
- No spaces after commas (wastes characters)

Generated keywords (100/100 chars):
`keyword1,keyword2,keyword3,keyword4,...`

These keywords target: [explanation of strategy]
```

### Description (4,000 characters max)

```
📄 Description

Structure:
- First 170 characters are visible before "Read More" — make them count!
- Lead with the main benefit, not features
- Include key features with benefits
- Add social proof if available
- End with a call to action

Generated description:

[FIRST 170 CHARS - THE HOOK]
[Full description with features, benefits, and CTA]

Character count: X/4,000
```

### Promotional Text (170 characters)

```
✨ Promotional Text

This is the ONLY field you can update WITHOUT submitting a new version!
Use it for seasonal content, new features, or promotions.

Generated options:
1. [Promotional text option 1] (X/170 chars)
2. [Promotional text option 2] (X/170 chars)
```

### What's New (for updates)

```
🆕 What's New

For your first release:
"Initial release! [Brief description of what makes your app great]"

For updates, format as:
• New: [feature]
• Improved: [enhancement]
• Fixed: [bug fix]
```

## Google Play Metadata

### Short Description (80 characters)

```
📱 Short Description (Google Play)

Your elevator pitch in 80 characters.

Generated options:
1. [Short description 1] (X/80 chars)
2. [Short description 2] (X/80 chars)
```

### Full Description (4,000 characters, searchable!)

```
📄 Full Description (Google Play)

Unlike Apple, Google INDEXES your description for search!
Include keywords naturally throughout.

Generated description:
[Full description optimized for Google Play search]

Keywords included: [list of keywords naturally incorporated]
```

## Screenshot Strategy

```
📸 Screenshot Requirements

Apple App Store:

- 1-10 screenshots per size

Google Play:

5. [Fifth screenshot: Call to action or additional feature]

Recommended caption text for each:

...
```

## Category Recommendations

```
📂 Category Selection

Based on your app, I recommend:

Apple App Store:
- Primary: [Category]
- Secondary: [Category] (optional)

Google Play:
- Category: [Category]
- Tags (up to 5): [Tag1], [Tag2], [Tag3], [Tag4], [Tag5]

Reasoning: [Why these categories make sense]
